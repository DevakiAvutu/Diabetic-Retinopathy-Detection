<p class="abc">Due to digitalization, the software sector has grown significantly since the corona virus outbreak. Up to 2017, there were over 2.75 million software engineers available in India. Nonetheless, this figure will rise to 5.2 million by 2023. When they use a computer or laptop for extended periods of time, while working, the majority of software developers experience eye sight issues. In India, there are currently about 80 million people with diabetes, and by 2045, this can be projected to be 135 million. The software engineerâ€™s eye sight issues could be more severe if they also have diabetes. Diabetic Retinopathy is the condition that results when a person has both diabetes and poor vision. Diabetic retinopathy affects about 30% of diabetes patients. The majority of people in the working age group around the world are affected by diabetic retinopathy, which is the greatest frequent factor of preventable loss of vision. In order to quickly identify, diagnose, and treat diabetic retinopathy before it worsens, we intend to create a deep learning model to do so. By extracting two features from retinal images Micron way, which is discovered to be the first symptom-showing feature, and Haemorrhage, which exhibits symptoms of further stages this seeks to discover the disease at the earliest stage feasible.<br>
<br><br>There are several issues with diabetes, one of which is diabetic retinopathy, which affects the eyes. It can cause total blindness and vision loss in severe cases. Some among the first signs of diabetic retinopathy include eye floaters, fuzzy vision, darkened portions of eyesight, and difficulty seeing colour. If you want to avoid going blind, you must correctly diagnose diabetic retinopathy in its early stages. Approximately 285 million people worldwide have diabetes mellitus, and almost three-quarters of them have diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes retinopathy will affect 191.0 million people globally by 2030, up from 126.6 million in 2010. Tiny red spots can be seen in the retina during the earliest phases that is non-proliferative. Those tiny patches might be haemorrhage, irregular blood vessel pouching might be microaneurysms. The linings of these blood arteries are vulnerable to damage, allowing fluid and fatty material known as exudates to spill out. Diabetic retinopathy can be diagnosed using pupil enlargement, a visual acuity screening, CT using optical coherence, and other physical exams. Yet, they are time-consuming and painful for the patients.</p>
