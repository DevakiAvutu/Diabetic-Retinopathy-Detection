<b style="color:#eb3b5a;">Stages:</b><br><br>
<b>Stage-0:</b> No Diabetic Retinopathy.<br><br>
<b>Stage-1:</b> Mild Diabetic Retinopathy(Non Proliferative) -  tiny areas of swelling in the blood vessels of the retina.<br><br>
<b>Stage-2:</b> Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy(Non Proliferative) - tiny blood vessels starts to interfere with blood flow to the retina, preventing proper nourishment.<br><br>
<b>Stage-3:</b> Severe Diabetic Retinopathy(Proliferative) - A larger section of blood vessels in the retina become blocked.<br><br>
<b>Stage-4:</b> Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy - new blood vessels form in the retina. <br><br>
<b style="color:#eb3b5a;">Treatement:</b><br><br>
Treatment starts with managing blood sugar and diabetes. This includes taking diabetes medication as directed by your doctor, watching your diet, and increasing physical activity.

Keeping blood sugar within a healthy range can slow the progression of vision loss.

Other treatments will depend on the stage or extent of the disease. If caught very early — before damage to the retina occurs — blood sugar management might be the only necessary treatment. Your doctor will continue to monitor your eyes, though, to ensure the disease doesn’t progress.

If you’re in a nonproliferative stage but experience some eye damage, treatment options might include:<br>

<b>Laser surgery:</b> Laser surgery, called photocoagulation, reduces the drive for abnormal blood vessels and swelling in the retina.<br><br>
<b>Eye medications:</b> A steroid injection in the eye can stop inflammation and prevent the formation of new blood vessels. You might also be a candidate for anti-VEGF medication, which can reduce swelling in the macula and improve vision. Doctors administer both treatments as an injection in the eye.<br><br>
<b>Vitrectomy:</b> If you have proliferative diabetic retinopathy, you might need an eye surgery called vitrectomy. This surgery treats problems with the retina and vitreous, a jellylike substance in the middle of the eye. The surgery can remove scar tissue, blood or fluid, and some of the vitreous gel so light rays can focus properly on the retina. At the same time, traction in the retina or retinal detachments can be corrected.<br>
